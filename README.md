# Emotion Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting emotions from text data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify and predict emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., based on textual input. This solution can be used in applications such as customer service, social media monitoring, mental health analysis, and more.

## Features

- **Emotion Classification**: Detects emotions from text using machine learning models.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based web application for real-time emotion detection.
- **Model Integration**: Incorporates pre-trained models for text analysis and emotion classification.
- **Testing**: Includes test scripts for verifying the performance of the model.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EmotionDetection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

The web application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Testing

To test the emotion detection functionality, run the test script:

```bash
python test_emotion_detection.py
```

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Open the web application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Input text in the provided form to predict the emotion.
3. The model will return the predicted emotion based on the input.

### Command Line

To use the emotion detection functionality via the command line, use the following:

```bash
python EmotionDetection/predict.py "<Your text here>"
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request.
